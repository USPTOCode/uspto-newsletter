- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React frontend offers an intuitive platform for users to manage newsletter content.
- **Customization**: Templates and styles can be adjusted to align with USPTO branding guidelines.
- **Deployment Ready**: Easily deployable using Docker for consistent environments.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the Python Flask application responsible for data processing and API endpoints.
- `frontend/`: Houses the React application that provides the user interface for newsletter management.
- `scripts/`: Includes utility scripts for setup and maintenance tasks.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration file for Docker, facilitating easy deployment of the application.
- `README.md`: This document.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USPTOCode/uspto-newsletter.git
   cd uspto-newsletter
   ```

2. **Initialize the Project**:

   Run the setup script to install necessary dependencies and prepare the environment:

   ```bash
   python scripts/setup.py
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**:

   Navigate to the backend directory and follow the setup instructions provided in its README:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Follow instructions in backend/README.md
   ```

4. **Frontend Setup**:

   Similarly, navigate to the frontend directory and set up the React application:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   # Follow instructions in frontend/README.md
   ```

5. **Docker Deployment** (Optional):

   For a containerized setup, ensure Docker is installed and run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build and start both the backend and frontend services.

## Usage

After installation, you can access the application through your web browser:

- **Frontend**: Typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API**: Accessible at `http://localhost:5000/api`

Use the frontend interface to create and manage newsletter content. The backend API handles data processing and storage.
